				<p>The first time I met Dave was likely at a gymnastics meet in Nebraska. Dave and my brother, Kent, were friends as well as gymnasts together. However, my first true memory of Dave was in middle school. Dave was hanging out with Kent at our house one night. When I conjure up this memory, I notice the feeling of butterflies in my stomach which I can only assume was due to a developing crush on this cute boy named, Dave. I wanted to hang out with them but, Kent would not let me...I suppose I was just the annoying sister at this point! Dave and Kent both moved on from gymnastics in their early teens. Years past and another memory comes to mind - I was in college and Dave was playing with his band, Oranjesta. I remember admiring he and his band's talent. </p>

<p>After college, I wanted to pursue a master's degree and move out of state. Everything fell into place and it was obvious the best school for me was in the sunny state of California. I had one friend, Emily, who had moved to LA a few months before. Soon after I moved, Emily brought my roommate, Chad and I, to a party which lo and behold, was filled to the brim with Nebraskans. I felt right at home! That summer night, I met Dave again after 10 years of no substantial contact. I was greeted by him with, "Wow! I can't believe you are here!" Dave seemed stunned I was in California and repeated this statement several times (looking back I think he was nervous!) I remember Dave's well-coiffed bouffant and his frequent use of Carmex. I recall one of my first conversations with Dave and thinking, "He's so humble about his talent.” He was also encouraging and non-judgmental of other musicians. His friends loved him and spoke highly of his character and his musicianship. </p>

<p>Dave and I became friends over the next few months - seeing each other at mutual friends' gatherings. I felt drawn towards Dave and continued to get to know him. Months pass and I decided to text Dave to wish him a Happy Valentine's Day and he responded with, "Will you be my Valentine?" I said yes, and he talked about wanting to take me to Disneyland. We were both shy and never went on that Disneyland date but, continued our friendship. </p>

<p>Over time, I began to see different layers of Dave’s personality - his amazing storytelling abilities, how he can impersonate people and voices like a pro and overall, entertain a crowd with his goofy sense of humor. Through his, what I assume to be, macho way of trying to impress me, I saw a softer side of Dave. He spoke intelligently about about various topics. I thought, “I could have deep conversations with this macho man!”  In the meantime, I was personally doing a lot of soul searching and trying to better myself with discipline in my health and spiritual life. I saw Dave was disciplined too as he had given up alcohol, processed foods and began to focus on his physical health. I was attracted to Dave's strong will, ambition and hard-working attitude. We continued as friends until one fateful night in Ojai, California which changed the script. Now here’s the deal...I'm not entirely sure but, I’m pretty certain all of our friends were in on a plan to finally get Dave to tell me he liked me. I knew this because somehow everyone had left the two of us alone by the fire that night. I was nervous, excited, yet calm as well. Dave motioned for me to come sit by him and we talked for hours. Needless to say, we had our first kiss under the stars that night. The next day May 1, 2011 marked our anniversary and the rest is history :) </p>

				<p>I most likely met Lindsay when I was about 10 years old.  My family and I had just moved from Florida as my father started a new job in Nebraska. I was an avid gymnast and my parents found a new club called Nebraska School of Gymnastics. Soon after I joined, I happened to make a really good gym buddy named, Kent.  Kent and I would hang out at each other’s houses a lot and that’s where I probably first met Lindsay.  Lindsay was Kent’s older sister and happened to be the same age as me.  I remember a lot of the guys on the gym team thought she was cute.  I definitely did too but I was probably too shy to tell her so. </p>

<p>A lot of time went by and eventually I moved on from gymnastics.  I started getting more involved with music and my love for the guitar was blossoming.  I left gymnastics around 15 years old and lost touch with most of my gymnastic buddies.  With that being the case, I didn’t see Lindsay much and we both had lives of our own.  </p> 

<p>Years went by and life just started to happen.  I graduated high school and went to Florida State to pursue a degree in classical guitar, only to quit after my freshman year to save up to move to Los Angeles.  I put the horse blinders on and worked feverishly at my music career once I arrived in LA.  </p>

<p>I was always a hard worker and didn’t really put much time into pursuing a relationship, even though I wanted one.  I definitely had pretty terrible luck trying to meet a girl in LA.  All the LA girls wanted someone I wasn’t.  I think I was just too nice of a guy - and those ‘Hollywood” girls weren’t really into that.  Oh, well. Haha! </p>

<p>Now, I had been in LA for almost four years, and at 24 thought it was going to be pretty tough to find a girl I could call, honey. Then, one amazing party night at my grungy house in the valley, a beautiful girl walked through the door.  Her smile glowed and her presence immediately reminded me of home. I literally stood there in disbelief with my mouth agape.  You can take a guess that this lady was - you guessed it, Lindsay. </p>

<p>I told her, “I can’t believe you’re here! Wow! You are really out here now? Really? This is amazing!”  Basically, I kept repeating myself over and over again. Finally, after almost five minutes, I realized I should let her sit down and not keep her standing in the entry way.  It was kind of difficult to pry her away from friends, but once I did I knew she was special.  She spoke passionately about pursuing a career in therapy. She was also in touch with her spirituality from the moment I met her. It was an attractive quality to see her interested in helping others.  Her soul was filled with kindness and the few moments I got alone with her just made me want more.  I couldn’t get her smile out of my brain.  She smiled constantly and I kept trying to make her laugh to do so. </p>

<p>After the party, I kept sending her messages and texts. I tried to space them out enough so I wouldn’t scare her away.  I remember looking at my phone and dreading to press send sometimes.  I suppose I was afraid of saying the wrong thing and just wanted her to like me.  I remember asking her to be my Valentine in a text and when she replied, yes, I had to tell every roommate in my house!</p>

<p>One day, down at 3rd Street Promenade in Santa Monica, I was driving around with my friend, Nick.  We were talking about Lindsay and I how much I liked her.  Ironically, in such a crowded city, I looked over to the right and saw Lindsay walking with her two friends.  Nick and I got out of the car to say hi to Lindsay.  Nick said something about how her and I would make a pretty cute couple and Lindsay’s cheeks turned a rosy red.  We chatted for a few minutes and then Nick and I hopped back in the car.  I was like, “Dude! Why did you say that?”  Nick told me to relax and that it would all be fine.</p>

<p>Lo and behold, Lindsay and I went on a camping trip with some friends in Ojai, CA shortly after.  The whole hike up Matilija Creek Trail consisted of me trying to impress Lindsay - as usual.  I remember walking in front of her and trying to clear every single branch and stone from her path.  It was pretty obvious at this point that I was smitten by her, but I didn’t care.  I promised myself I was going to tell her how much I liked her on that trip.  It was rather difficult though as all of our friends were around.  I was hoping at some point I could get her alone and just tell her how I felt.  By the grace of God, around 3 AM that night when everyone was sleeping, I did just that.  I probably spent a couple hours rambling from topic to topic sitting on a log with her.  I admired how intently she listened.  She truly made me feel comfortable with her patience.  I finally mustered up the courage inside and said, “Dave! What are you doing? Tell the poor girl already before she falls asleep!” Amazingly, I was able to tell Lindsay how I felt.  It was the best decision of my life when I leaned over and kissed that girl around the campfire.  My whole life changed from that moment under the stars.  </p>

<p>I truly feel our relationship was meant to be.  My Dad always says “the Lord works in mysterious ways.”  Who would have thought the woman of my dreams lived only a mile away from me my entire youth?  Her Dad even took me to gymnastics at times and lent me one of my first guitar amps to play as a kid.  Pretty wild isn’t it? Meeting Lindsay definitely made our lives come full circle.  It’s pretty incredible how our paths led to finding each other in the storm that is Los Angeles.  God has truly blessed us. I am grateful.</p>
