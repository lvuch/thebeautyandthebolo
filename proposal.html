			<p>Oh, where to begin?  I knew I wanted to marry Lindsay really early on in our relationship.  I probably would have proposed in the first year, but I didn’t want to scare her away!  So, I chose to wait patiently and let it happen when the time was right.  Lindsay and I have been really dedicated to both of our separate careers and I wanted to propose when I felt the engagement could be enjoyed by the both of us.  I started to sense our tide was shifting and thought prior to the holidays in 2014 would be perfect.  I’ve been dating Lindsay since 2011, so I had plenty of time to find a unique setting for my Great Grandmother’s diamond that was gifted to me by my Grandma Pat.  I asked my Grandma if I could have that diamond when I was a little boy and she honored it.  It’s definitely a keepsake that will continue to be passed on.  It wasn’t easy, but I finally ended up finding something I thought was just right!  Once I had the everything locked down in October, I felt I had what I needed to propose - the ring!</p>  

			<p>I thought long and hard about how to do it, where to do it, and what time of day I should do it.  I ultimately decided I wanted to take Lindsay on an adventure.  I found this great bed and breakfast called the Groveland Hotel in Groveland, CA.  It was only a little west of Yosemite National Park and I felt it would be really beautiful.  I figured I could propose to her in the forest somewhere and just needed to pick a spot.</p>  

			<p>So, I told Lindsay that I wanted to take her on an early trip for her birthday in October and just to go do something fun.  I planned it with her a couple weeks before and tried to play it as cool as I could.  I am pretty sure my Mom knew I was going to propose that weekend.  She knew where we were at all times driving up from Los Angeles with what seemed like GPS precision.  She reminded me multiple times that I should get tire chains as I knew she was just wanting it to go smoothly.  Never deny a mother’s instinct...they know everything.  I never told her what I was doing but she just knew. </p> 
			<p>On our drive up, Lindsay noticed that I was getting a little testy.  I wanted to make it up there by a certain time for check in to our hotel, and I felt we were running late.  I wanted to make it to Glacier Point in Yosemite by sunset and it was looking like it wasn’t going to happen.   Lindsay kept trying to tell me to relax because we were on vacation.  I told her I was fine but she had no idea I planned on proposing to her that night with the ring in my coat pocket!</p>

			<p>We finally made it through the hotel and the lady at the counter said I took the most dangerous route in.  Go figure!  We then dropped our bags off in our room called, Lotta Crabtree.  It was a very unique bed and breakfast and each room had its own vintage flair.  We only stopped for a bit as I kept in mind that we need to get into the park.  Now, this is where the story gets interesting.</p>

			<p>I grabbed a map of Yosemite from our hotel and frantically tried to figure out how to get to Glacier Point from Groveland.  I had studied this map for hours prior, but I felt like I forgot everything!  The sun was starting to go down and our phones were going in and out of service.  I no longer could count on my navigation.  It was up to me to make this work!</p>

			<p>I finally make it inside the park before 5:00pm and the Ranger let’s us in.  It must have taken us 45 minutes just to get to the entrance!  I realized at that very moment that where I wanted to go was literally impossible.  We probably had about an hour of light left and I had to make a change of plans in my head as to where we were going to stop. </p> 

			<p>I was making Lindsay nervous as I was trying to drive and look at the map at the same time.  She kept telling me to focus on the road but I kept peeking at the map in her hands.  I kept thinking about a different look out point that I could take her to and was trying to navigate on the fly.  I knew I should have just focused on the road but, I really wanted to take her to somewhere beautiful.  It was dark in there because of the massive, dense trees that surrounded us on both sides.  We were coming up to where the road split off and I took a look down at the map again.  Just like that...I look up and slam on the brakes thinking for certain I was going to hit this deer that ran onto the road.  Lindsay put her legs up to brace herself and I pushed the brakes down as hard as I could and only slightly spun to a stop.  Miraculously, our little white Honda Civic stopped what seemed to be inches before this deer frozen in headlights.  A couple seconds later, two more deer cross the road and the three deer pranced away unharmed.</p>

			<p>I look over to Lindsay and she says, “That’s it!  Put down the map!”  I replied, “Yes, honey. You’re right. I’m really sorry about that.  There’s no excuse.”</p>

			<p>She replies, “I told you time and time again, but you didn’t listen!  You almost killed three deer and us!”  I felt pretty low at that moment and just kept the car going at a decent speed and trying to look out for more deer.  I was pretty sure at this moment that I kind of killed the evening and felt pretty bad about it.  Lindsay was really nice to me and we both thanked God for his protection in that moment.  We laughed it off and moved on - phew! It was a wake up call to me that I needed to let our good Lord drive the car and take us to where we needed to go. </p>
			<p>I sat in torment for what seemed like an eternity to get out of these trees and find us a viewpoint.  This ring was about to burst out of my pocket and I promised myself I was going to propose that night.  Luckily, we were driving and Lindsay noticed a little trail we could hike up to catch the sunset.  I parked the car and made it seem like this is exactly where we were supposed to be.  I told her, “Isn’t this place beautiful?  I thought you would like what I picked!”  Lindsay just laughed at me and we both started hiking up this little pass in the mountains.  The view was absolutely ridiculous and had more colors and trees than I ever thought existed on this planet.  We were both in awe.  I was even more in awe of what I was about to do. </p> 

			<p>With the sun setting, I found us a nice big rock to sit on.  I surprised her with one of those mini bottles of Moscato from my coat and we both took a sip.  Shortly after, I had her stand up with me. I told her, “I love you, Lindsay.  I want to be the angel that greets you in heaven one day.”  We both started to tear up. I then got down on one knee and said, “Will you marry me?”  Amazingly, my sweet Lindsay said, “Yes!”</p>
